## Capstone Idea (Definition Statement)

I want to build an application that……for my capstone project, i am building a web app that supports farmers meet their creative, development and digital needs by hosting an exchange network that connects them to digital freelancers with time to offer in exchange for CSA, reduced venue rental or other products/services already offered at the farm. the idea is to connect two end users - farmers and freelancers - who are traditionally not connected, but in order to turn the tide on environmental restoration perhaps should be. even with very different skill sets, each end user is getting a need met and putting action behind their concern for the environment or building healthy communities.


## Definition of Audience - Who Will be Using My Application?

For this project, my end users are based in Chattanooga, TN. My initial idea was to solely focus on the farm that I have an existing relationship with already, Crabtree Farms, however there may also be opportunity to include other voices from farmers at Cove Creek Farm, American Farmland Trust, Young Farmers of Tennessee, Erin’s Meadow Herb Farm, Reflection Riding Nursery, Nemagarden and Greenspaces.

## Outline of Content

What do I want on each page?  (text / pics / images / navigation)

Home - call to action, images, idea box
Origin Story - compelling story, cortina bio, savvy coders banner, form, sm icons
Farmers - directory, highlight icons + facts, profile photos
Freelancers - directory, highlight icons + facts, profile photos
Contact - freelancer req form, freelancer app form, highlighted skills, map

What do I want the functionality of each page to be?

Home - This page will host some compelling art combining nature with code, sacred geometry found in the coding world to visually represent a bridging of worlds. Other items might include an idea/suggestion box. Simplicity is key.
Origin Story - This page will host compelling why, idea form, developer info.
Farmers - This page will host a directory of farms to share the following: overview of history, vision and mission of the farm; photo gallery; list of what is available in the CSA box; digital freelance needs; hours of operation; contact info for the farm which must include a physical, verifiable address and phone number, etc
Freelancers - This page will host a directory of freelancers to share the following: skill inventory; links to portfolio/completed projects; certifications; public reference info; a timebank for hours logged with farmers; contact info which must incl.  a verifiable phone number and at least a zip code for geo-location mapping in the future.
Contact - This page will host a form for users to complete for a follow-up connection, map, application forms (between farmer and freelancer), images that have links to download liability waivers, background check release, profile sheet, etc.

## Purpose of Application

According to recent surveys of young farmers by the American Farmlands Trust, 35% of young farmers name the cost of production as greater than the price received for the products.. In that same survey, it was reported that 41% of young farmers name finding access to capital to grow their business as very or extremely challenging. With this web application, features become available to farmers who may have otherwise been invisible to the greater community while also attracting quality talent through a built-in bartering system. In this case, the freelancer is supporting a local farm; improving health and overall quality of life by consuming locally grown foods and produce; and community is fostered through a shared mission to protect and preserve natural resources. This is a way technology can help do that.

## Business or Real World Problem I'm Solving

This web application solves several problems:

- connects farmers with high quality, digital talent they may not otherwise have access to for non-physical, creative labor (i.e. web design, marketing, SEO, upgrades)
- connects freelancers to their local farmers in an authentic way, which can foster a sense of place, belonging and community
- provides farmers with needed services while removing financial barriers to access
- creates a wellspring of other paid and service opportunities for the freelancer with others who are also connected to the farm, leading to more business and clients
- provides freelancer with locally grown, organic foods that could improve wellbeing
- promotes the farm to greater visibility, which will help with long-term sustainability
- creates a tipping point for farms to leverage support to secure future funding/grants

## Comparative Research Analysis

Other web applciations that are product-adjacent to mine:

- WWOOFF
- HelpX.net
- NuMundo
- Yoga Trade
‌- Workaway
- Worldpackers
- Working Traveller

List what you like about each site:

- WWOOFF - promotes ecological sustainability, agri-tourism, legacy
- HelpX.net - love their profiling feature for hosts and companions, this could work!
- NuMundo - love the simple, bright design mixed with action shots + profiles
- Yoga Trade - more of a high-quality feel to the site, paid attention to typography
- ‌Workaway - combines community build, education and seeking opportunity
- Worldpackers - built on a sense of collaboration between hosts and providers
- Working Traveller - shows high demand/need for freelance in creative, IT + digital

List what you do not like about each site:

- WWOOFF - overwhelming amount of destinations to choose from globally
- HelpX.net - it doesn’t set the helper up for success regarding logistics/planning
- NuMundo - isn’t always up to date and doesn’t convey how remote sites are
- Yoga Trade - creates a sense of exclusivity to create value ($48/year)
‌- Workaway - it is more of a resource library than an engine with actual people
- Worldpackers - more abroad opportunities than local
- Working Traveller - good model but based in the UK, diff market set than this one

How my application will be different:

- WWOOFF vs FF = not emphasizing visitors or solely physical farm education
- HelpX.net vs FF = will not require/cannot accommodate living with a host family
- NuMundo vs FF = not focused on providing accommodations
- Yoga Trade vs FF = focus on digital freelance in agriculture, not yoga/wellness
- ‌Workaway vs FF = not focused on cultural exchanges or volunteer holidays
- Worldpackers vs FF = not focused on volunteer holidays
- Working Traveller vs FF = zooming in on jobs in creative, IT, digital space

## SWOT Analysis

STRENGTHS

Prior profess experience with web design + project mgmt
Focus on community, environment,, connection, engagement and mutual aid which are unifiers across differences
Not currently a web app exactly like this one
Gap in market provides opportunity to engage end user early + build loyalty

_How can strengths be maximized?_
Design web app to my strengths in design and keep code simple

WEAKNESSES

Learning curve of coding to build web app in 12 wks
Not knowing what I do not know, yet, and how that will impact timeline
Short beta testing cycle before web app has to be presented + functional
Limited functionality (no login or payment portal for “true” membership)

_How can weaknesses be minimal?_
Give extra time at milestones.
Practice sections outside of class time.

OPPORTUNITIES

Eco-tourism, wellness community apps out there prove there is a need
Current partnerships + collabs with Tennessee Valley farmers + tech community
Conversation starter for potential investors or think tanks
Future grant funding for tech and ag

_How can opportunities be taken advantage of?_
Prioritize LinkedIN profile.
Network with local tech comm, intro my coding journey. Ask for coffees.
Host talks or topics @ meetups.

THREATS

Not much else out there to compare it to, potential disruptor app
Conservative end-user may be distrusting of tech
Tech-savvy end user may have higher expectations
Building up a solid base of Tennessee Valley freelancers (not tourists)

_How can these threats be avoided?_
Ask for support from instructors, mentors and coaches
Be myself in spaces..be uncomfortable if necessary
Use my DEI + facilitation training to help w/ comm
Be open minded
Don’t take shit personally

## Capstone Reflection

The most impactful project I have completed in the last year is my web application - landScape. This web development application connected local farmers and digital freelancers to engage in a value exchange of goods and services that enhanced the quality of life for everyone involved and bridged a community gap through common need + shared desire (i.e. time freedom, capacity widens/distribute labor, access to healthy foods, building community network, etc). The web application profiled 10 local Chattanooga farms and 10 freelancers as a beta-test to provide a space where both groups could connect over digital content and farmgoods. Not only was the resulting app impactful for farmers to meet a need that otherwise goes unmet as they focus time on the physical labor demands of the farm, it was also impactful for web developers to access healthy foods & farmgoods as opposed to reaching for the more convenient, fast food, which in turn negatively impacts their productivity and performance on the job. This was a win-win for everyone due to the evidence of how technology can positively contribute to our lives and provide time freedom, which reduces stress and adds to our overall well-being. Furthermore, high quality work is being achieved on all sides and there is a stronger community as a result.
