    <p> Your mission is to support me to return to my fullest health and vitality. Let me explain!
      The year is 2023 and the world is seemingly in chaos from all the waste, litter and over-
      consumption of resources. During this time, I have become unplugged from what brings me
      joy, harmony and balance. Can you help? For the first time in history, all of nature
      has spoken and we agree that it will take human intervention to fix a human-created problem.
      The only way to complete the mission successfully is to invoke full cooperation and creativity
      between farmers and freelancers. It is your job as either farmer or freelancer to forge a path
      of sustainability with your neighbors and get me plugged back in before it's too late.</p>
<p>
      And remember, the power is yours!
